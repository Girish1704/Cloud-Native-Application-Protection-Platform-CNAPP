        # https://aka.ms/yaml
        trigger: none
        pool: windows-build-agents
        steps:
        - task: UseDotNet@2
          displayName: 'Use dotnet'
          inputs:
            version: 3.1.x

1. Click the **Save and run** button again.

       ![](images/m3-img40.png)

       > **Note**: At this point the job will queue up to run. This step may take some time to spin up a build agent in the VMSS. During this time, if you go back to VMSS dashboard you will see that the instance is getting created.

1. In a few more minutes, the job will start to have some activity as shown the example below:

       ![](images/m3-img44.png)

1. Once it finishes you can see scan done by Defender for DevOps. To do that click **Microsoft Security DevOps** section in the left and you will see the output of the actions that were done as shown below:

       ![](images/m3-img45.png)

   <validation step="847540fb-759b-44cd-b6ca-b2b88f5ce8e9" />

   > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
   - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task. 
   - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
   - If you need any assistance, please contact us at labs-support@spektrasystems.com. We are available 24/7 to help you out.

This exercise focuses on configuring your pipeline using YAML to observe how the Defender for DevOps extension evaluates and checks the pipeline.

## Summary

This module covers setting up a secure DevOps environment by configuring the Azure ADO Connector and Microsoft Security DevOps Azure DevOps Extension. It includes installing the SARIF SAST Scans Tab extension, creating a hosted build agent and pipeline, and configuring the pipeline using YAML to integrate and manage security checks effectively.

# Module: Defender Cloud Security Posture Management 

### Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## Overview
 
A hypothetical organization, "Acme Inc." had a robust cybersecurity infrastructure in place. However, one day, an attacker used a brute force or password spraying attack to gain access to an Internet-exposed server of the organization. 

The attacker could quickly move laterally through the network, exploiting vulnerabilities on the Internet-exposed servers and gaining access to the organization's Storage Accounts, SQL servers, and Key Vaults. The SOC department was alerted by Defender for Cloud on the “Brute Force, Password Spray” IOC/IOA, and quickly realized something was wrong when they noticed unusual activity on the servers and Storage Accounts. 

In response to the attack, the security engineers leveraged the attack path analysis to identify the entry point of the attack and the path the attackers used to move laterally through the network. Based on this analysis, they were able to close the entry point and cut off the attackers' access to the organization's data. 

However, the IT department didn't stop there. They also took a proactive approach by implementing security recommendations to fix the vulnerabilities on the Internet-exposed servers and prevent similar attacks in the future. They also implemented a robust incident response plan and conducted regular security training for employees to educate them on how to identify and avoid brute force and password spraying attacks. 

Thanks to the combination of both reactive and proactive measures, Acme Inc was able to prevent a major data breach and keep their sensitive information safe. This hypothetical use case demonstrates the importance of having both a reactive and proactive approach when it comes to cybersecurity, including performing attack path and security risk analysis, implementing security recommendations, assigning/managing change actions to the proper owners, and educating employees to prevent future attacks.  

Next exercise will show how to leverage the Attack Path feature of Defender for CSPM. 

## Lab Objectives: 

You will be able to complete the following exercises:

- Enabling Defender CSPM plan (Read Only)

In this exercise, you will investigate and review potential attack paths in your environment in Read-Only mode to understand vulnerabilities without making changes.

1. From **Defender for Cloud** menu, open **Attack path analysis**.

    ![](./images/upimg1.png)

    >**Note:** You may not find any attack paths in your environment as we have enabled Defender CSPM recently, it will take time. As this is a read-only task just continue with further steps.

1. Click on **Attack path**. You will find the Attack Paths in your Environment. 

1. Click on **“Internet exposed VM has High severity vulnerabilities and read permission to key vault”**.

      ![](images/m1-img14.png)
 
1. You can observe the Attack path and the resources involved in the attack path.

1. Remediate the recommendations to resolve the attack path. 

1. Explore the rest of the Attack paths found in your Environment and remediate.

This exercise involves examining and reviewing potential attack paths in your environment in Read-Only mode to gain insights into security risks without altering any configurations.

## Exercise 3: Build query with Cloud Security Explorer (Read Only)

In this exercise, you will use Cloud Security Explorer in Read-Only mode to build and review queries that analyze your cloud security posture without making any modifications.

1. From **Defender for Cloud** menu, open the **Cloud Security Explorer** page.

      ![](images/m1-img6.png)
    
1. Select a predefined query Template **“Internet exposed VMs with high severity vulnerabilities” (1)** and click on **Search (2)**.

      ![](images/m1-img7.png)
